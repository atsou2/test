# Clothing Quality Rating App

## Project Description:
The goal of this project is to create an app that evaluates the quality of clothing on online shopping sites based on provided images. The app will assess various aspects of clothing quality such as fabric texture, stitching, and overall appearance. Users can upload or link product images, and the app will provide a score along with a breakdown of the quality parameters.

### Features:
- **Image Analysis**: Process and analyze images to identify fabric texture, material quality, stitching accuracy, and patterns.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Train a model on a dataset of clothing images with associated quality scores.
- **Quality Rating Breakdown**: Provide a rating based on factors such as texture, color vibrancy, stitching, and overall design.
- **User Interface (UI)**: Simple and user-friendly interface for uploading images and receiving quality ratings.
- **Integration with Online Shopping Platforms**: Option to scan images from URLs of clothing products from e-commerce websites.
- **Data Storage**: Store results for future reference and comparison.
- **Recommendation System (Optional)**: Suggest better alternatives based on the results.

## 15-Week Timeline with Milestones:

### **Week 1-2: Research & Planning**
- **Deliverables**: 
  - Finalize app concept, features, and technical requirements.
  - Identify and select image processing and machine learning tools
  - Prepare a detailed wireframe or prototype of the app UI.
  - Collect an initial dataset of clothing images with quality annotations.
  
### **Week 3-4: Dataset Creation & Preprocessing**
- **Deliverables**:
  - Curate and clean the dataset (images and quality scores).
  - Perform data augmentation to ensure the model is trained with a wide variety of images.
  - Preprocess the images (resizing, normalization).
  - Label the images for training (texture, color, stitching, etc.).

### **Week 5-6: Building the Image Processing Pipeline**
- **Deliverables**:
  - Set up an image recognition and processing pipeline using tools like OpenCV or similar libraries.
  - Build a feature extractor for identifying different aspects of clothing quality (e.g., texture, stitching).
  - Perform initial testing of image analysis functionality.

### **Week 7-8: Developing the Machine Learning Model**
- **Deliverables**:
  - Train the initial version of the machine learning model for rating clothing quality.
  - Use classification or regression algorithms to map image features to quality scores.
  - Evaluate model performance using a validation dataset.

### **Week 9: Model Fine-Tuning & Optimization**
- **Deliverables**:
  - Improve the accuracy of the model by fine-tuning hyperparameters.
  - Experiment with different algorithms to enhance performance.
  - Optimize for faster inference times.

### **Week 10-11: Backend Development**
- **Deliverables**:
  - Build the backend to handle image uploads and processing.
  - Implement API endpoints for interacting with the machine learning model.
  
### **Week 12: Frontend Development**
- **Deliverables**:
  - Develop a simple and intuitive UI for users to upload images or input URLs.
  - Display quality scores and visual feedback based on model outputs.
  - Ensure a responsive design that works on both mobile and desktop.

### **Week 13: Integration and Testing**
- **Deliverables**:
  - Integrate the frontend with the backend and ensure smooth communication.
  - Test the app across various devices and scenarios (different image types, resolutions, etc.).
  - Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) to identify and fix bugs.

### **Week 14: Deployment**
- **Deliverables**:
  - Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
  - Deploy the app to a cloud platform (AWS, Google Cloud, or similar).
  - Conduct final checks to ensure scalability and robustness.

### **Week 15: Launch & Post-Launch Support**
- **Deliverables**:
  - Officially launch the app and begin user onboarding.
  - Collect user feedback and usage data for post-launch updates.
  - Plan for future updates, such as adding new features like the recommendation system.
